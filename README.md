# Shell scripting tutorial

## A first script

File: my-script.sh \
Run: ./my-script.sh \
The first line tells Unix that the file is going to be executed by /bin/sh \
Commend line is marked with "#" 

## Variables

File: var.sh \
File: var2.sh \
Declaration VAR=value \
There is no space between. VAR = value doesn't work \
The shell does not care about the type of variables, they may store strings, integers, real number or anything. They are all stored as strings. \
You can interactively set variable names using read command
